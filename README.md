# DrawingApp

 A drawing application which can help in you write or draw anything you like. 
 It supports:
 5 pen types
 RGB colors and Color pallet selection.
 PDF Reader 
 Screen shot when reading PDF
 Zoom in/Zoom out for PDF and Canvas.


Note: Removed .ppt reading capability because the lib didn't support androidx and was causing trouble during migration. Updated the code base to Kotlin.
